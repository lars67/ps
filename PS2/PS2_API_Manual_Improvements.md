# PS2 API Manual - Suggestions for Improvements

Here are some suggestions to improve the PS2 API manual:

*   **Add more detailed descriptions of the API endpoints and parameters.** The current descriptions are brief and could be expanded to provide more context and information. For example, the description of the `filter` parameter in the `collections.list` endpoint could be expanded to include information about the types of filters that are supported and how to use them.

*   **Include examples of how to use the API endpoints in different programming languages.** This would make the manual more accessible to developers who are using different programming languages. For example, the manual could include examples of how to use the API endpoints in JavaScript, Python, and Java.

*   **Add information about error handling and troubleshooting.** This would help developers to troubleshoot problems that they encounter when using the API. For example, the manual could include a section on common error codes and how to resolve them.

*   **Include diagrams and flowcharts to illustrate the API workflows.** This would make it easier for developers to understand how the different API endpoints are related to each other and how to use them to accomplish specific tasks.

*   **Add a glossary of terms.** This would help developers to understand the terminology used in the manual.

*   **Improve the styling of the HTML manual to make it more visually appealing.** The current styling is basic and could be improved to make the manual more engaging and easier to read. For example, the manual could use a more modern font, add more whitespace, and use color to highlight important information.
