# Active Context

## Current Focus

Initial project analysis and Memory Bank population based on user request.

## Recent Changes

- Allowed 'member' role access to `prices.historical` command.
- Initialized core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Populated `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md` based on project analysis.
- Committed permission change and Memory Bank initialization.

## Next Steps

- Commit Memory Bank updates from analysis.
- Switch back to Code mode to address any pending implementation tasks or user requests.
- Further refinement of Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`) requires user input.
